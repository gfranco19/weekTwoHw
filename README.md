### Minimum Requirements

* Functional, deployed application
<!--site is funcitonal-->
* GitHub repository with README describing the project
<!--uploaded to github the project will be used a reference page.
it had functional buttons and links to different html files, has one master css files. Only issue is the portfolio page which got abstracted differently than other pages and i cannot seem to find the diference in code for basic elements. Tried sticky footer with a bostrap navbar and the java script button moves it as well, not ideal. Overall its functional but not ideal needs more improvement-->
* Navbar must be consistent on each page.
<!--consistent in functionality but not format wise in portfolio page// couldnt figure out why-->

* Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.
<!--links fully functional except github and linked in, they where added to the footer for fun-->
* All links must work.
<!--top navbar links work-->

* Must use semantic html.
<!--semantic html used and positioned accordingly-->
* Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)
<!--not html errors found-->
* Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)
<!--personlized to my best kowledge-->
* Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.
<!--tried to comlete project mainly off bootstrap and bootstrap only, used google fonts as well-->

### Bonus

* Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (**Hint:** Check out the Bootstrap documentation).
<!--sticky footer used but could not figure out how to keep it from overlapping in media view-->
